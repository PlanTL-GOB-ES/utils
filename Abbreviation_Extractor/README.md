# Abbreviation Extractor

## Introduction

This script is used to extract abbreviations and definitions from biomedical texts written in Spanish, by detecting abbreviations and their potential definitions explicitly mentioned in the same sentence.
This script is used internally at the AbreMES-X project (https://github.com/PlanTL/AbreMES-X) to generate the Spanish Medical Abbreviation DataBase (https://github.com/PlanTL/AbreMES-DB). This script is provided to everyone in order to make use of on your own projects.

We use a modified version of the algorithm developed by Schwartz & Hearst[1], adapted to the Spanish language and applying specific filters to improve the results. Users are permitted to change the code and adapt it to their needs without any restrictions, like adapting the abbreviation-definition extractor into other languages, domains, or other document types to analyze.

## Prerequisites

This software has been compiled with Java SE 1.8 and it should work with recent versions. You can download Java from the following website: https://www.java.com/en/download

Some of the detected potential abbreviations could be geophysical locations' names. In order to filter these abbreviations and discard them, the script makes use of the GeoNames ontology. GeoNames is a geographical database which covers over eleven million placements. GeoNames is distributed under Creative Commons BY-4.0 license. It is available for download free or charge: http://www.geonames.org
